<h2>Maps & Location</h2>
<h3>How does subTerra track my finds?</h3>
<p>
When you record a find or take a photo the app uses your phone's built in GPS receiver to store the location.
</p>
<h3>Why does subTerra ask for location access?</h3>
<p>
Apple ensures that all apps request permission from the user before accessing the GPS receiver.
</p>
<h3>How do I enable GPS tracking for my digs?</h3>
<p>
If location permissions have previously been denied:
<br>
Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > subTerra and set to <b>Always</b>.
</p>
<h3>How accurate is subTerra’s location tracking?</h3>
<p>
This can vary due to certain environmental factors such as terrain, weather and buildings. GPS signal accuracy is displayed in the info window during a dig.
</p>
<h3>Why is my location not showing correctly on the map?</h3>
<p>
Check that location permissions are set to <b>Always</b> in:
<br>
Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > subTerra
</p>
<h3>Can I use subTerra without GPS?</h3>
<p>
This app's core functionality depends on its ability to access the GPS receiver. Nothing useful can be accomplished until that permission has been granted.
</p>
<h3>Why can’t I zoom in equally on all map types?</h3>
<p>
Maps that use satellite images sometimes don't allow the same level of zoom as the other types. This is due to the limitations of the satellite imagery itself.
</p>

<h2>Photos & Media</h2>
<h3>Why are there two types of photo?</h3>
<p>
You can take find photos or dig photos. Find photos are for documenting your finds and are attached to that find, while dig photos are a more general reminder of your dig.
</p>
<h3>How do I take a photo of my find within the app?</h3>
<p>
You can take a photo at the same time as you record the find by using the camera button. You can also use the camera button at the bottom of any find's info screen.
</p>
<h3>Where are my find photos stored?</h3>
<p>
A low resolution version of your photo is stored within the app. A full resolution copy is stored in your Photo Library if you have selected this option in the app Settings and you have given the appropriate permissions when prompted.
</p>
<h3>Can I add more than one photo per find?</h3>
<p>
Yes, you can add as many photos as you want to a find.
</p>
<h3>Why can’t I save photos to my Photo Library?</h3>
<p>
Check that Photos permissions are set to <b>Add Photos Only</b> in: 
<br>
Settings > Privacy & Security > Photos > subTerra
</p>
<h3>How do I delete a photo from a find?</h3>
<p>
Photos can be deleted from the Photos section of the Digs tab or from within the Find screen itself.
</p>
<h3>Can I annotate my find photos?</h3>
<p>
You can give your photos a name in any of the photo screens.
</p>


<h2>Target ID & Find Categorisation</h2>
<h3>What is a Target ID?</h3>
<p>
Target ID is the number shown on your detector's display when it detects your find. It indicates the metallic composition of the buried object and can also be affected by the size and shape and depth of the find.
</p>
<h3>Why are some finds missing from my Target ID chart?</h3>
<p>
To be shown on the chart, finds must be assigned a Target ID <b>and</b> a material <b>and</b> a detector.
</p>
<h3>Why is the unknown category always showing in my charts?</h3>
<p>
You can choose to hide the unknown category from your charts by selecting the switch in the Settings & Support tab.
</p>
<h3>How do I hide the categories with zero finds?</h3>
<p>
You can choose to hide the categories with zero finds from your charts by selecting the switch in the Settings & Support tab.
</p>

<h2>Data Management & Exporting</h2>
<h3>Can I export my finds data?</h3>
<p>
Yes, find data can be exported to several file formats. This can be done for an individual find within that find's details screen or for all finds within the Finds tab.
</p>
<h3>What file formats does subTerra support for exporting finds?</h3>
<p>
subTerra supports .csv, .kml, .geojson and .gpx file formats.
</p>
<h3>Why can’t I export images with the find data?</h3>
<p>
The export formats are text based and do not support images however if you have chosen to export a copy of your photos to the Photos Library, you can export them from there.
</p>
<h3>How do I back-up my subTerra data?</h3>
<p>
If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device all of your subTerra data is automatically backed up - including finds, digs, photos, landowner details and settings —
<br>
To ensure your data is backed up:
<b>
<br>
1. Open the Settings app.
<br>
2. Tap [Your Name] → iCloud → iCloud Backup.
<br>
3. Ensure “Back Up This iPhone” is turned ON.
<br>
4. Tap “Back Up Now” to manually back up your latest finds.
</b>
</p>
<h3>Can I transfer my finds to a new device?</h3>
<p>
Yes. If you have <b>iCloud Backup enabled</b>, your finds and all other subTerra data will be restored <b>automatically</b> when setting up a new iPhone from an iCloud Backup.
</p>
<h3>How do I delete all of my data?</h3>
<p>
You can use the button at the bottom of the Support section of the Settings & Support tab to delete all of your detecting history including finds, digs, photos, boundaries and landowner details. Use this option with extreme caution as it cannot be reversed except by restoring your entire phone from an iCloud Backup.
</p>

<h2>Landowners & Permissions</h2>
<h3>Is landowner information shared outside the app?</h3>
<p>
No, never.
</p>
<h3>Can I link a landowner to multiple digs?</h3>
<p>
Yes. You can link a landowner to multiple digs by adding them to the Landowner section of the dig's view.
